# Simple Apache/PHP/Mysql Server
Apache server setup for capistrano deployment demonstration at
comorichweb. Nothing special that enables capistrano, just a typical
setup so I had a server to go against.

## Setup
Run local_setup.sh to add an entry to your /etc/hosts file for
my.example.com. 

## Users
aside from vagrant, there is a www-deploy user that belongs to the
www-data group. His password is 'password'.

## Running
* install vagrant
* clone this repo
* type vagrant up
* profit
